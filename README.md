# microtribes
Microtribes is a slow social network built with React, GraphQL, and Directus as a backend-as-a-service. It aims to prioritize the most relevant content for users, rather than overwhelming them with constant updates.

This project is licensed under the MIT License, and contributions to the code are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.

To get started with Microtribes, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/microtribes.git
cd microtribes
npm install
```
You also need to setup a connection to the Directus Backend.

Once everything is set up, you can start the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

Thank you for considering Microtribes for your social networking needs. We hope you find it useful!
